Everyone ->
--------------------------------------------------------
- clone the github repository onto desktop (talk to me, jason)
- install kivy and run main.py, you should see hello world


Kivy Peeps -> Ema, Tyler, Riley, Ava, Kobe
NOTE: Work in the main project folder, main.py is all you
---------------------------------------------------------
- finalize the "ideal" interface with Tyler and the rest of the group
- trim down the "ideal" interface to the bare bones and use that as a first goal
- break down the bare bones interface into elements (dropdown bar, button, tab, text input)
and assign each one to a group member, successfully run that element.


Database Peeps -> Shane, Anthony
NOTE: Work in the database folder, everything in there is all you
---------------------------------------------------------
- load a datapoint from the csv file into python and have it display to the console
- think of how you might structure the data so that it is easily accessible to 
kivy and graph people (talk to me)


Graph Peeps -> Trey, Jimmie
NOTE: Work in the graph folder, everything in there is all you
---------------------------------------------------------
- figure out how to implement a line graph with a timestamp for the x-axis
- create a key for the graph with each color/lineType corresponding to a different building
- use "fake" data for now, just get a proof of concept
